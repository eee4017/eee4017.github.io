#### manifest.json

If you open up this file you’ll se a bunch of json, including the dreaded:

```
”short_name”: “React App”,
“name”: “Create React App Sample”
```

We can go ahead and customize that.

This file exists to provide app and extension info, such as name, icon and description, in json format. This comes in handy when your website behaves like an app, for instance when a user adds your website to their mobile homescreen. The manifest.json file will be compiled and added as a link tag in the head of the HTML template in index.html:

`<link rel=”manifest” href=”%PUBLIC_URL%/manifest.json”>`

This is a good time to address that funky looking `%PULIC_URL%` tag. Remember the ‘escape hatch’ React provides in case we put assets in the public folder? During the build, assets prefixed with the `%PULIC_URL%` tag will be recognized and complied. However this is NOT best practice and should be used only when necssary.
